### 7. Operators

Operator are mainly divided by three groups.

1. Uniary Operators that takes one values
2. Binary Operators that takes two values
3. ternary operators that takes three values

Operator are mainly divided by three groups that are totally seventeen types.

1. Arithmetic Operator 
```
+ = Addition
- = Subtraction
* = Multiplication
/ = Division
% = Modulo
** = Exponentiation
```
2. Assignment Operator
```
 = "equal to
```
3. Array Operator
```
+ = Union
== = Equality
=== = Identity
!= = Inequality
<> = Inequality
!== =    Non-identity
```
4. Bitwise Operator
```
& = and 
^ = xor
| = not
<< = shift left
>> = shift right
```
5. Comparison Operator
```
==  = equal
=== = identical
!=  = not equal
!== = not identical
<>  = not equal
< = less than
<= less than or equal
> = greater than
>= = greater than or equal
<=> = spaceship operator
```
6. Execution Operator
```
 `` = backticks  
```

7. Error Control Operator
```
@ = at sign
```

8. Incrementing/Decrementing Operator
```
++$a = PreIncrement
$a++ = PostIncrement
--$a = PreDecrement
$a-- = Postdecrement
```

9.  Logical Operator
```
&& = And
|| = Or
! = Not
and = And
xor = Xor
or = Or
```

10. string Operator
```
. =  concatenation operator
.= concatenating assignment operator
```

11. Type Operator
```
instanceof = instanceof
```

12. Ternary or Conditional operator
```
?: = Ternary operator
```

13. Null Coalescing Operator
```
??" = null coalescing 
```

14. Clone new Operator
```
clone new = clone new
```

15. yield from Operator
```
yield from = yield from
```

16. yield Operator
```
yield = yield
```
17. print Operator
```
print = print
```
